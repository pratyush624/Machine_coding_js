1. Go to the root of any project:

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the root directory of your project using the cd command. For example

```
cd path/to/your/project
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

- In the project root directory, run the following command to install all the dependencies specified in the package.json file:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

- Once the installation is complete, start the development server by running:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will launch the project in development mode, and you can view it locally in your browser, usually at http://localhost:5173 (depending on the project configuration).
